## Feature #1 - Chat Customizing
There are some settings available to make the chat look more like you want.

The activated "Highlight trades" checkbox will show "selling ..." and "buying ..." messages in green and red boxes, switch the font to bold and change the font colors as well. The other settings should be self explanatory most of the time. If not than just play around with them and see what happens :)   
You always have to hit the "Save & Reload" button to let your changes take effect, except when you want to reset your settings completely. The "Reset to default" button does exactly that and it does it immediately, it will reload the page automatically.
